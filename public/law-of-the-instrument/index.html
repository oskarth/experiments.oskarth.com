  <h1>Law Of The Instrument</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to solve the problem you already know how to solve, as
opposed to the problem that matters. This is true even if you are
aware of it.</p>

<p>This March, I introduced Unfolds in a
<a href="http://blog.oskarth.com/unfolds-a-jungle-of-ideas-prototype">blog post</a>. Seen
as an experiment, Unfolds was a failure. It&rsquo;s on the order of 500
lines of Clojure/Clojurescript code, and despite being my main hacking
project for about a month, it failed to test an actual hypothesis.</p>

<p>What I set out to do with Unfolds was to get to the gist of an idea in
a few hundred words. This is mostly a problem of writing these gists
clearly and concisely. Without that you have nothing. I was well aware
of this, but yet I approached the problem by spending my time writing
a tool for creating and browsing these gists. What went wrong? We can
get a clue by listening to the words of Abraham Kaplan:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I call it the law of the instrument, and it may be formulated as
follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything
he encounters needs pounding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My hammer was programming, and I was pounding away at a tool that
served a subordinate purpose to gists that don&rsquo;t even exist yet.</p>

<p>The real problem here is so difficult, and I hadn&rsquo;t sufficiently
deconstructured and simplified it, that I ended up trying to solve a
different problem. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if what you are building is
clever if it doesn&rsquo;t solve a real problem. An hypothesis that can
reasonably be falsified would function as a compass, and keep the
pursuit honest.</p>

<p>Would making a tool necessarily be a bad idea? No, but that would be a
different direction and a different hypothesis. If you are building a
house with just a hammer, you&rsquo;ll have a bad time cleaning windows.</p>

<h2 id="what-would-a-real-hypothesis-look-like:6b88f7334be4fa2dbac03e6a172d8291">What would a real hypothesis look like?</h2>

<p>The idea behind Unfolds is still potent, and there are many questions
and hypotheses hiding in it. Here are a few sketches of assertions
that can be tested.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can communicate the gist of an idea in less than 200 words. By
gist we mean that reading these words will be enough for most
research purposes.</p></li>

<li><p>The first 200 words of a Wikipedia article do not satisfy the
metric in 1.</p></li>

<li><p>This author can explain ten concepts in under 200 words. This is
only true for concepts that are familiar to him.</p></li>

<li><p>Images and illustrations are vital in a few select domains, but not
needed in the majority of explanations. Specifically, there&rsquo;s a
trade-off in time investment, and it&rsquo;s usually not worth it.</p></li>

<li><p>There exist heuristics which make a short explanation particularly
good or particularly bad. These can be discovered. It&rsquo;s possible to
build tools that encourage good explanations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many more, but these are things on the top of my
head that&rsquo;d be interesting to investigate. Some assertions are easier
to test than others, and I&rsquo;ll probably revisit the matter soon.</p>
