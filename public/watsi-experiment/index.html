  <h1>The Watsi Experiment</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Fri, May 1, 2015</span>
      

<p>Along with Wikipedia, Watsi is probably one of the best uses of the
Internet I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I have no association with Watsi, except as a user.</p>

<p>Watsi specialize in low-cost, high-impact healthcare funding. 100% of
donation money goes to a specific patient of your choice, and they are
ridiculously transparent with their finances (there&rsquo;s a google doc
linked from their website containing all their operations and
financials, including screenshots of bank transfers for each
operation). In short, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a better way to fund
healthcare around the world.</p>

<p>Last Christmas, I decided to conduct an experiment. I wanted to give
people an opportunity to use Watsi, but instead of giving a large
amount to a few people, or a medium amount to some people, I decided
to give a small amount to many people.</p>

<h2 id="hypothesis:2406d8910f03d4cf56e52ea4977a7227">Hypothesis</h2>

<p>I did not make a clear hypothesis back then. I was generally curious
about how many people would give Watsi a try, and how many of those
would find it compelling enough to use again. As one person put it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My inner engineer can&rsquo;t help but appreciate that it&rsquo;s likely to
amplify your original donation by roping in some more people too!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was my intution too.</p>

<h2 id="experiment:2406d8910f03d4cf56e52ea4977a7227">Experiment</h2>

<p>Around Christmas time, 16 friends, family and acquaintances got a
small dollar dollar gift card ($5 for most, and $20 for family), along
with an email explaining Watsi and that this was part of an
experiment.</p>

<p>This was not completely thought out. I had opted people into something
without their permission, and several things were unclear (what is the
experiment exactly? what if I don&rsquo;t want to participate?). After some
feedback I sent a second email to clarify that if they didn&rsquo;t use
their gift certificate within three months, the money would go to
Watsi&rsquo;s Universal Fund.</p>

<p>Three months later, I sent a second email asking people to fill out a
short anonymous 30 second survey. I got a response rate of <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>. The
questions I asked were the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Had you used Watsi before?</li>
<li>Did you use your gift card?</li>
<li>On a scale of 1-10 (10 being certain), how likely is it that you
will donate to Watsi again within the coming year?</li>
<li>Comments/suggestions/critiques (optional)</li>
</ol>

<p>The responses were as follows. Only 1 person had heard of Watsi
before, 2 people did not use the gift certificate, and the answers to
the third question was: 2-3-3-4-4-6-6-6-7-8-10.</p>

<p>That only 1 person had heard of Watsi before came as a surprise to me,
and indicates that Watsi is still very small - there&rsquo;s already a
sample bias in the people I chose, as a lot of them are involved in
tech and the startup world.</p>

<p>Assuming that those who didn&rsquo;t respond to the survey didn&rsquo;t use it,
implies that more than half used their certificate, which is still
pretty good. There were however some problems. One person tried to use
the gift card two or three times, but wasn&rsquo;t able to claim it without
being logged in. Setting up an account did not help the matter
either. This is unfortunate and seems to be a, hopefully temporary,
bug in their system.</p>

<p>The third question is a trick I learned from my marketing class many
years ago. The idea is that in such questions, only 9 and 10
constitutes a real yes. If we are being generous, we could call a 7 or
8 a maybe, but the rest are best treated as a no. This means we have 1
yes and 2 no, out of 16 people.</p>

<p>This last result was surprising to me - I would&rsquo;ve assumed this number
would be higher. I&rsquo;ll talk more about this in the next section.</p>

<p>Here are some other comments that people made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I donated in my mom&rsquo;s name</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Tried to set up my own regular donation but I was not allowed to
give a lump sum and too much was lost in currency exchange when
transfers were made monthly. I contacted them for alternatives such
as pay pal but no joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed by the follow up with information sent to me about the
receiver of my donation.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure I&rsquo;d do it this year &ndash; I think it would be more successful
if the campaign was more connected to something that meant to
me. Like educating inner city kids etc.</p>

<p>Yeah &ndash; mostly I&rsquo;m just super disconnected from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot with Kiva, and honestly I&rsquo;m more likely to continue
with that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion:2406d8910f03d4cf56e52ea4977a7227">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a successful experiment in that we could test the hypothesis,
even if it was ill-specified. It turns out that people are quite
willing to use a gift certificate, but not as interested in using
Watsi again.</p>

<p>Given my own high opinion of Watsi, and
<a href="https://www.changemakers.com/sites/default/files/styles/project_slider/public/growth-graph.png">their</a>
<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-QO__bCcAADarb.png">amazing</a>
<a href="https://chartio.com/hmedia/images/blog/2015/03/watsi-data/universal-fund-donations.png">growth</a>,
which indicates that they are doing something that people really want,
what went wrong?</p>

<p>The biggest error source is the way the experiment was set up. There
was a lot of unclear and bad communication on my part, and there was
absolutely zero intent among the people surveyed. This was something I
didn&rsquo;t expect, but it makes a lot of sense. People have different
priorities, are at various stages in their lives, and have a limited
amount of attention. Consider this example: people want cars. It&rsquo;s a
huge industry, people need to get from point A to B. But if you were
to semi-randomly ask people if they want to buy a car from a certain
brand within the next year, most people would say no. Even adjusting
for the different magnitude in purchase decision, that alone is enough
to explain how few people would use it again.</p>

<p>In fact, despite my initial disappointment, that I got ~10 more people
to know about the existence of Watsi, and that 1 out of 16 will try
Watsi again (a number that would be 2 if they fixed their European
payment options), should be seen as a success, albeit a small one.</p>

<h2 id="future-work:2406d8910f03d4cf56e52ea4977a7227">Future work</h2>

<p>I see two interesting directions. One is to set up a better experiment
with a bigger sample, and make it opt-in, as opposed to opt-out like
my experiment was. The other is to explore the concept of intent. For
example, what would happen if whenever someone expresses intent of
helping people with healthcare, or talks about wanting to help people
in poor areas, they would get invited to try Watsi for $5? Of course
we have to be careful getting too spammy, but the fact that (a) 100%
goes to the person and (b) it&rsquo;s real money, would mean that the risk
of that would be almost negligible.</p>

<p>There are many opportunities that open up with the Internet, and Watsi
is a great model for charity in the 21st century.</p>
