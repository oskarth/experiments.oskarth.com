  <h1>nand mental 1</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, May 18, 2015</span>
      

<p>In the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been working my way through the excellent
book <em>Elements of Computing Systems - building a modern computer from
first priniples</em> as a part of the equally excellent <em>Nand to Tetris</em>
course. I started reading the book a few years ago when I attended
Recurse Center, but instead of completing it I ended up
<a href="http://blog.oskarth.com/writing-a-dsl-in-clojure">writing a domain specific language</a>
for the first few chapters. A useful exercise, no doubt, but this time
around I intend to finish the whole book.</p>

<p>The main reason I want to go through the book is because I want to
have a better sense of how a computer works, and get a rough idea how
one could build one. In a sense its value is proportional to how well
it serves as a mental value for the real world.</p>

<p>So how does it stack up? This is the first of multi part series,
starting with the first three chapters of Elements of Computer Systems
book. I wrote down a collection of assertations that I wanted to diff
with what&rsquo;s out there in the real world. Let&rsquo;s begin.</p>

<h2 id="assertions:1020ccf035e58b69dd7be0eb6a0180c7">Assertions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Any boolean function can be built from NAND gates.</p></li>

<li><p>Logical chips are built up from more elementary ones.</p></li>

<li><p>Negative numbers are usually represented by the radix method.</p></li>

<li><p>In binary addition, overflow is normal and not an error.</p></li>

<li><p>Our ALU is essentially the same as a real one.</p></li>

<li><p>DFF : Sequential chips :: NAND : Combinatorial chips.</p></li>

<li><p>There&rsquo;s a clear divide between combinatorial and sequential chips.</p></li>

<li><p>There&rsquo;s one master clock that keeps track of computer time.</p></li>

<li><p>Our Register, RAM and Program Counter are essentially realistic.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="reality-check:1020ccf035e58b69dd7be0eb6a0180c7">Reality check</h2>

<p><strong>1. Any boolean function can be built from NAND gates.</strong></p>

<p>This is called functional completeness. The same goes for the NOR
gate, but isn&rsquo;t done as much for performance reasons.</p>

<p>TODO: We can prove it as follows: [write down or link]</p>

<p>Is this done in practice? Why / why not? Has it be done?</p>

<p><strong>2. Logical chips are built up from more elementary ones.</strong></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>a) A multiplexor is built from Not, And and Or gates.
b) A HalfAdder is built from Xor and And gates.</p>

<p>To what extend is this true?</p>

<p><strong>3. Negative numbers are usually represented by the radix method.</strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the state? Alternatives? Used more?</p>

<p><strong>4. In binary addition, overflow is normal and not an error.</strong></p>

<p>Accurate? Why this makes sense, and maybe why it could be dangerous -
who&rsquo;s responsible? why no error bit?</p>

<p><strong>5. Our ALU is essentially the same as a real one.</strong></p>

<p>A real ALU has more control bits, for example for doing multiplication
in hardware. Also word width of course (32 or 64).</p>

<p>Find a ALU diagram for some new chipset that proves or disproves this.</p>

<p><strong>6. DFF : Sequential chips :: NAND : Combinatorial chips.</strong></p>

<p>There are more flip-flops, what are they? Is DFF used a la 2?</p>

<p><strong>7. There&rsquo;s a clear divide between combinatorial and sequential chips.</strong></p>

<p>Aside from implementation of DFF in terms of NAND gates (neat design,
link to cool explanation?).</p>

<p>Also, aren&rsquo;t real-world combinatorial chips sequential? Or is it more
of a toy-model that works (since you don&rsquo;t use purely combinatorial
chips in isolation), similar to classical mechanics?</p>

<p><strong>8. There&rsquo;s one master clock that keeps track of computer time.</strong></p>

<p>Is this the same as the processor machine? Is there more than one
time? Unknown unknowns?</p>

<p><strong>9. Our Register, RAM and Program Counter are essentially realistic.</strong></p>

<p>Register just bits, bit made from Mux and DFF. RAM stacked in units
(8, 64, 512 etc) - just registers and DMux/Mux ways with interface of
input, output, load bit and address bits. Likewise with Program
counter - just one at this level? With load, inc, reset options.</p>
