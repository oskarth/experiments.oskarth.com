  <h1>Law Of The Instrument</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, May 7, 2015</span>
      

<p>Have you ever read a blog where the first (and often, only) post is
one about how the author set up the blog? This is a typical problem
for programmers. It&rsquo;s a case of solving the easy problem, the one they
know how to, as opposed to the real probem, which is the one that
matters - to actually write something. A little more than a month ago,
I made a similar mistake.</p>

<p>This March, I introduced Unfolds in a
<a href="http://blog.oskarth.com/unfolds-a-jungle-of-ideas-prototype">blog post</a>.
Unfolds is on the order of 500 LOCs and 60 commits, but despite being
my main hacking project for about a month, it fails to test anything
useful.</p>

<p>Ironically, I knew the problem I was trying to solving was mostly a
content problem, as opposed to a tool problem, yet I attacked it by
writing a tool. Can tools help?  Absolutely, but that is a separate
question, and it wasn&rsquo;t my guiding principle when thinking about the
problem. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if what you are building is clever if it
doesn&rsquo;t solve a real problem.</p>

<p>Outside of this meta-lesson, did I learn anything? Absolutely, but I
would have learned a lot more if what I built was guided by the
problem. As a basic example to illustrate my point: why was I setting
up a Datomic database when just keeping everything in-memory would&rsquo;ve
been fine?</p>

<h2 id="what-would-a-real-hypothesis-look-like:ec0a197feb26282df2fbb891c7786f4f">What would a real hypothesis look like?</h2>

<p>The idea behind Unfolds is still potent, and there are many questions
and hypotheses hiding in it. Here are a few sketches, and some
thoughts on them.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you understand an idea, can you get the gist of it across in
less than 200 words? More precisely: is there any standard
configuration (i.e. not individualized) of a limited set of words,
such that reading them will be enough in answering the basic
questions a person has while trying to understand an idea?</p></li>

<li><p>If you only have a limited amount of time, does reading the first
200 or so words of Wikipedia satisfy 1 above? Can we do better than
Wikipedia on the metric we outlined?</p></li>

<li><p>Can this author explain 10 concepts himself under 200 words? How
does understanding the concepts deeply play into the choice of
words? Essentially it&rsquo;s a compression problem, and I suspect
knowledge of the source material is vital.</p></li>

<li><p>Can we find a test for what makes a good explanation? A friend of
mine wisely suggested that removing specific examples would be
tempting, but most likely wrong.</p></li>

<li><p>Can we create a tool that somehow encourages clear and concise
writing? Examples: use of limited vocabulary, auto-suggestions of
links.</p></li>

<li><p>How much of a difference does links make? If we can bootstrap an
explanation using other, possibly subordinate, explanations, this
would help with the compression a lot. In fact, this is in a sense
how language works.</p></li>

<li><p>What about images and illustrations? Which types of illustrations
are useful for understanding, and which are vital? For example,
maps are distinctly superior to any verbal-only explanation you
could come up with. On the other hand, there&rsquo;s a trade-off in
editable and time investment.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many more, but these are things on the top of my
head that&rsquo;d be interesting to investigate. Some are easier to test
than others, and I&rsquo;ll probably revisit the matter soon.</p>

<h2 id="lessons:ec0a197feb26282df2fbb891c7786f4f">Lessons?</h2>

<p>Aside from the problem domain, I think the lesson here is simple but
trite: If all you have is a hammer, you will treat everything as a
nail, but with the added twist that this is true even if you are aware
of it.</p>

<p>So what can we do about it? I think there are a few things. First of
all, sometimes it&rsquo;s ok - maybe if I kept naively working on Unfolds it
would have lead me somewhere interesting.</p>

<p>Secondly, by releasing something before it&rsquo;s ready you get some time
to let reality kick in and reflect.</p>

<p>And lastly, by using a stricter framework, such as, in my case,
thinking about it in terms of an experiment with a falsifiable
hypothesis, we can make real progress, faster. Luckily, I was born
after the scientific revolution when this idea became widespread, so I
didn&rsquo;t have to figure this out myself, and neither do you.</p>
