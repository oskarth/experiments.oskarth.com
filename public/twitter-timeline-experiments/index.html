<p>How to follow pmarca on Twitter?</p>

<p>Many months ago I asked a group of people this question. @pmarca is
the Twitter handle for Marc Andreessen, a prolific tweet and inventor
of the Tweetstorm (among other things) [1]. He has lots of interesting
to say, but he averages more than 100 tweets a day, which is not
something I feel like keeping up with.</p>

<p>Common answers to this question are: (a) don&rsquo;t try to be keep up, and
(b) make judicious use of lists. While useful, I don&rsquo;t think these
suggestion hits the core of the problem:</p>

<p>A person tweeting 100 times a day gets equal exposure to someone
tweeting once a day, even though you are equally interested in what
both people have to say.</p>

<p>This is the noise problem. The obvious solution is to make your
exposure to tweets proportional to your interest in them, but this is
hardly as easy as it sounds.</p>

<h2 id="hypothesis:30e308bf15979e89f0889989bb1ec4d3">Hypothesis</h2>

<p>Filtering out half my tweets, either at random or by some tweet
velocity metric, will make my Twitter browsing a more enjoyable
experience.</p>

<h2 id="experiment:30e308bf15979e89f0889989bb1ec4d3">EXPERIMENT</h2>

<p>Levelfield REST API, OAuth 1 not getting working, many requests
otherwise, too much hassle.</p>

<p>Relatif Streaming API, take a bunch of ids and get lots of data, max
5000, otherwise user API, unclear how to get working client-side, lots
of work. Problem is with no favourite count, so can&rsquo;t measure
velocity.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion:30e308bf15979e89f0889989bb1ec4d3">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>Essentially these experiments were failures. Future directions.</p>

<p>Ill-specified: Another thing is read-only. Hypothesis came after, was
seeing it more as a prototype so I was doing some interface work that
didn&rsquo;t end up being useful.</p>

<p>A lot of work to setup the other thing, so
to get a reasonable feedback loop I ended up using pmarca&rsquo;s Twitter
stream, but these results I didn&rsquo;t really care about. I also did some
batching.</p>

<p>Too complicated?</p>

<p>Good case study in where motivation is low.</p>

<p>Lost momentum both cases.</p>

<p>Might try again.</p>
