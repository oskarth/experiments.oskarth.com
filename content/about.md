Yes

Ok it just shows it all but that reloading, sweet jezz.

Oh it's 70 words! So that's a lot more. Why so many words? Who wants to read that much?

I certainly don't. Well well, could always use the more thing.

Ok it just keeps going and going, how long is 70 words anyway?

Omg.

This is 79 words!!! Ok, it stops at 80 words. would rather have at 80 chars.
